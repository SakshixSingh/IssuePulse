# Problem Statement

Cities and local communities face everyday infrastructure problems such as potholes, broken streetlights, water leaks, garbage overflow, and unsafe public spaces. While citizens often notice these issues early, there is no effective system to convert these observations into actionable and accountable civic responses.

Existing civic complaint platforms mainly focus on collecting individual complaints. They treat each complaint as a separate issue, leading to:
- Duplicate reports for the same problem
- No meaningful prioritization
- Lack of long-term insights
- Poor transparency on resolution status

As a result:
- Authorities are overwhelmed with unorganized data
- Citizens lose trust due to lack of updates
- Recurring infrastructure failures remain unnoticed
- Resources are not allocated efficiently

IssuePulse aims to solve this by acting as a civic intelligence platform rather than just a reporting system. It focuses on identifying patterns, verifying issues through the community, and generating area-level insights that help authorities and citizens understand the real health of public infrastructure.
